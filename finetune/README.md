## Usage

1. Place your raw training data in the `data/raw` directory
2. Use scripts in `scripts/preprocess` to prepare your data
3. Configure your training parameters in `scripts/train`
4. Run training scripts to finetune models
5. Find your trained models in the `models/final` directory
6. Monitor progress through logs in the `logs` directory

## Notes

- Keep large data files and model checkpoints out of version control
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large binary files
- Consider using data version control (DVC) for managing large files
